# Overview

These plant-uml models were largely AI-generated by ChatGPT.

# Prompt(s) for futher work...

The plant-uml diagram definitions represented the user-visible VMware/VCF concepts visible in the
Various UI's of VCF: vSphere, SDDC and NSX.

They are broken into separate files for clarity and ease of maintenance.

Note that all entity names are qualified (aka "namespaced") with prefixes like "global", "host", etc. It is crucial that we continue to maintain this so that the entire system is consistent.

## Goal & Scope
The objective is to create a PlantUML-based data model of user-visible entities from the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) UI ecosystem.

Coverage includes vSphere, NSX, and SDDC Manager interfaces.

The model represents logical and configuration constructs, not low-level implementation details.

## File & Namespace Structure
The PlantUML is organized into multiple .puml files, one per domain (e.g., global, cluster, host, nsx, vcenter, availability).

All entity names are qualified with a prefix (e.g., global.Cluster, host.Bios) to ensure:

Unambiguous cross-file references

Consistency across diagrams

Support for merging into a single model later if desired

## Associations & Cardinality
Cross-file relationships are fully supported by qualified names (e.g., global.Cluster --> host.Host).

Multiplicities follow PlantUML syntax with quotes, e.g. "1", "0..*", and are interpreted by a parser.

Role names (e.g., : hosts) are added when helpful for clarity.

## Comments & Descriptions
Comments using ' syntax are included and parsed into Model.Description and Property.Description.

Descriptions explain both class purpose and field semantics.

This makes the .puml files readable both by tools and humans.

## Parser
A custom parser reads .puml files into internal classes (Model, Property, Association) in C#.

The parser supports:
* Qualified names
* Comments â†’ descriptions
* Multiplicity parsing
* Validation of associations

## Diagram Scope Strategy
Initial model covers:

* global
* cluster (cluster, configs, datastore, vm, etc.)
* host (host, hardware configs)
* edge (Edge Node, Edge Cluster)
* nsx (NSX Manager, Transport Zones, etc.)
* vcenter (VCenter + Datacenter)
* availability (Availability Zones, Fault Domains)

Shared entities (e.g., cluster.Cluster) are not duplicated across files.

Further modeling should follow this referential consistency rule.

## Optional Nice-to-Have Notes
All PlantUML diagrams are valid and parseable.

Eventually, diagrams may be merged or visualized together via tooling.
